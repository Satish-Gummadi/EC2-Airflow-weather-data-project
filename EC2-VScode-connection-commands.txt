Create an EC2 instance on AWS console

---------

In security Inbound rules add 

-> your IP address
-> port 8080

only after doing this we can access airflow through our Public IPv4 DNS in EC2.

---------

SSH client

ssh -i "EC2-VScode-SSH-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-12-345-67-890.compute-1.amazonaws.com


---
to configure EC2 on VS Studio

1) Install SSH remote extension on VS code

2) Then click on left bottom icon similar to >< and click on Connect to Host

3) Click on configure host 

4) Select the first path specified. Here copy and edit the following

# Read more about SSH config files: https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config
Host weather-data-project
    HostName 1.23.45.678
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\EC2-VScode-SSH-key.pem

5) After this save the file

6) Now repete step 2 and this time select the new host created in config file.

7) Select the linux machine and other details. This will connect our VS to EC2

8) Now open the new terminal to check the connection.

Note: 1) If you get any error, it can be either due to config file or due to key.
In such case try oprning SSH settings in VS code and add config file path over there.
Also try keeping the key in smaller paths to avoid key detection errors.

2) In case you are stopping and starting the EC2 instance, the public IP will change. Hence you have to
update the Hostname in cofig file in VS code everytime you stop and start EC2 instance (when connecting
to same instance).


---------------------

-- commands used in terminal

mkdir project

cd project

touch main.py

sudo main.py


---------------

sudo apt update

sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo apt install python3.10-venv

python3 -m venv airflow_venv

source airflow_venv/bin/activate

-- inside virtual environment use

sudo pip install pandas

sudo pip install s3fs

pip install requests

sudo pip install apache-airflow

airflow standalone

-- now copy the username: admin and password from the terminal and use them in browser for website localhost:8080

username: admin
password: -------------------

-- airflow Standalone is for developement purpose only. Do not use this for production

------------------------------

To access Airflow web interface

navigate to our EC2 instance

copy Public IPv4 DNS and paste it in browser. Add :8080 at the end. The complete url will look like this:
http://ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080

Enter username and password

----------------

API calls:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=guntur&appid=dcce08df2f68d12345c080a8270e5ca8


-----------------
In Airflow

Admin >> connections >> +

add a connection with:
	connection id: weathermap_api
	connection type: HTTP
	Host: https://api.openweathermap.org

And Save it

--------

Go to VS code and open airflow.cfg. Just check and confirm that dags_folder = /home/ubuntu/airflow/dags

-------

Edit all the dags as mentioned in code

------

-- Create an S3 bucket to store our dataframe as csv in that location

Once done we have to do following things

1) Create a IAM role with S3 access and EC2 access, and assign this role to EC2
	For this go into Our instance >> Actions >> Security >> Modify IAM role >> Create new IAM role

2) We have to create an Access key
	To create secret access key go to our account >> Security credentials >> Access key >> Create Access key

Access key: --------------------------

Secret access key: -----------------------------

3) Navigate to our EC2 instance, install AWS CLI in our EC2 instance (code below) and then configure our access key and secret in EC2.

sudo apt install awscli

aws configure

-- enter key and secret and keep remaining default.

aws sts get-session-token

-- output(key,secret and token) of the above we will add to our dag code.

4) On done we then need to change the save location in our transform function and also specify the credentials crom config file in aws inside our transform function.


s3 bucket name: weatherdata-airflow-ec2-s3-project
