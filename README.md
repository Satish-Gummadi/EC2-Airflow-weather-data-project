# EC2-Airflow-weather-data-project
In this project I had used EC2 instance to install and run airflow. 
I had written a weather dag and configured the terminal so that I can extract weather data from API, transform it and load it in S3 bucket in regular intervals orchestrated on Airflow.
You can gothrough my commmands text to understand different steps and connections involved while solving this problem statement.

The output after creating the DAGs will look something like the image below:
